Title: Bifurcation Analysis of Ordinary Differential Equation Systems
Version: 0.0.3
Authors@R: c(person("Andre M.", "de Roos", email = "A.M.deRoos@uva.nl", role = c("aut", "cre")))
Description: Performs bifurcation and phaseplane analysis of systems of ordinary differential equations. 
    The package allows for computation of equilibrium curves as a function of a single free parameter,
    detection of transcritical, saddle-node and hopf bifurcation points along these curves, and
    computation of curves representing these transcritical, saddle-node and hopf bifurcation points
    as a function of two free parameters.
